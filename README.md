Thanks for [kingeasternsun](https://github.com/kingeasternsun). He give me the idea of this repository.
As you know, Golang can't have two main function in folder when you're using go-modules.
So we can't run or manage codes conveniently.
So... As you see, I use **go test** to do that. Just place your codes in same folder.
Run the test code with `go test -v` instead of a main function so everything is resolved.
